# darwin-sdk


Darwin SDK is a python 3.x interface to Darwin<sup>TM</sup>.

SparkCognition<sup>TM</sup> has developed the next stage in machine intelligence with Darwin<sup>TM</sup>, a platform that automates the model building process and amplifies the potential of any data scientist. Darwin replicates the mind of a data scientist by automating the cleaning of data, performing latent relationship extraction, and determining the optimal model to solve a given problem.

Darwin is a major advancement from traditional machine learning, which operates via manual data cleaning, feature generation, and parameter tuning. These traditional approaches run into several problems: They take time to design and implement, often struggle to scale across large operations, and can be limited by edge cases that occur under extreme or unusual operating parameters. By contrast, Darwin creates dynamic models that are highly accurate and take less time to develop.
